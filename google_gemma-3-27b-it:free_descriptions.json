At the front is a more robust, often boxy or streamlined vehicle (the locomotive) which is typically darker in color and may have a single large headlight. The entire structure is elongated and moves horizontally along fixed metal tracks, often appearing to stretch far into the distance. It may also exhibit features like doors, pantographs (for electric trains), and various markings/logos on its sides.",
  "trout": "Here's a visual description of a trout for an AI model, keeping the provided definition in mind:\n\nTrout are typically streamlined, fish-shaped with scales that exhibit a variety of coloration \u2013 often olive-green, brown, or silver with a speckled pattern of black, red, or brown spots across their body and fins. They generally have a moderately sized mouth, and a forked, rather than rounded, tail. Size varies, but generally they appear smaller and more slender than salmon; averaging under 2 feet in length. A distinctive feature is often a reddish or orange-toned ventral area and sometimes a vibrant pink or red stripe along their lateral line. Fin placement is standard for fish - dorsal, pectoral, pelvic, anal, and caudal - though fin shape and coloration can differ between species.",
  "tulip": "Tulips are typically upright plants with elongated, strap-shaped or broadly lance-shaped leaves growing from a single central point. The most recognizable feature is a single, cup- or star-shaped flower atop a smooth, slender stem. These flowers come in a vast array of colors \u2013 red, pink, yellow, purple, white, and bi-colors are common \u2013 and possess six distinct, petal-like segments. Flower shapes can range from pointed and fully open to more rounded and closed, sometimes appearing almost symmetrical. Overall plant height varies, but generally ranges from 6 inches to over 2 feet tall.",
  "turtle": "Turtles exhibit a distinctive, often rounded or oval, hard shell covering their body, ranging in color from brown and green to black. They typically have a relatively small head that retracts into the shell, and legs adapted for either swimming (flipper-like) or walking/digging (clawed). Shell patterns can vary greatly, from smooth to ridged, and may include spots or stripes. Size varies enormously, from a few inches to several feet long, but the presence of a protective shell is the defining characteristic. They generally have a beak-like mouth lacking teeth.",
  "willow_tree": "Willow trees are typically recognized by their gracefully drooping branches, often reaching towards the ground, creating a weeping effect. The leaves are long, narrow, and lance-shaped, usually a light to medium green color. Bark is often gray and furrowed, becoming more textured with age. Overall form can range from a large, spreading tree to a smaller, multi-stemmed shrub, but a key visual cue is the flowing, pendulous appearance of the foliage. They are commonly found near water sources.",
  "wolf": "Wolves are large canids, typically 3-5 feet long, with a powerful build and long legs. Their coat color varies greatly \u2013 from pure white in arctic regions to gray, black, and reddish-brown elsewhere \u2013 but is generally thick and dense. They have a broad snout, erect, pointed ears, and piercing yellow or amber eyes. A key feature is a bushy tail, usually carried down rather than curled, and relatively large paws. While resembling a large dog, wolves generally have longer legs and a more muscular, less rounded head.",
  "beaver": "Beavers are medium to large-sized mammals, typically brown in color, with dense, waterproof fur. They have a robust, stocky build and a characteristically broad, flat, paddle-shaped tail covered in scales. Their front paws are small and nimble, while their hind feet are large and webbed for swimming. They possess prominent, continuously growing incisors \u2013 often orange-tinted \u2013 used for felling trees and building. Their eyes and ears are relatively small, positioned high on their head, allowing them to see and hear while mostly submerged.",
  "beetle": "Here's a visual description for an AI model, focusing on appearance:\n\nBeetles are typically small to medium-sized insects with a hard, protective shell-like exterior covering their bodies, often in shades of black, brown, red, or metallic green/blue. A key feature is a distinct division of their wings: the front pair are hardened and thickened into protective covers called elytra, which meet down the back in a straight line, while underneath are delicate, membranous hind wings used for flight. They possess visible legs (usually six) and often have noticeable antennae, and their mouths are adapted for biting or chewing \u2013 though this isn\u2019t always visually apparent. Body shapes vary widely, from elongated and cylindrical to rounded and dome-shaped.",
  "butterfly": "Butterflies are visually defined by their brightly colored, often patterned wings which are typically broad and held vertically when at rest. They have relatively slender bodies, often appearing delicate, and are characterized by long, thin antennae that frequently feature small clubs or knobs at the tips. Colors range widely \u2013 think vibrant yellows, blues, oranges, and reds \u2013 and wings can display intricate designs like spots, stripes, or eye-like markings. Overall shape is symmetrical and graceful, contrasting with the more robust bodies of many other flying insects.",
  "camel": "Camels are large mammals with long legs and necks, typically sandy-brown in color, though shades can vary. A defining feature is one or two prominent humps on their back, used for fat storage. They have relatively small heads with dark eyes and thick eyelashes, and a split upper lip. Their bodies are covered in dense, shaggy fur, particularly during colder months, and they possess broad, padded feet well-suited for walking on sand. Overall shape is bulky and somewhat rectangular, with a sloping back leading to a short tail.",
  "cattle": "Cattle are large, four-legged mammals typically ranging in color from black, white, red, brown, or various mottled combinations of these. They possess a robust, blocky build with a broad head and short, blunt horns (though some breeds are polled, meaning hornless). Their bodies are covered in relatively short fur, and they have a distinctive dewlap \u2013 a flap of skin hanging beneath the throat. Size varies greatly by breed, but generally they are substantial animals with a deep chest and a relatively level back. They often have large, dark eyes and a wet, leathery nose.",
  "crab": "Crabs are generally wide-bodied creatures with a distinct, flattened shell (carapace) covering their upper body. They move sideways thanks to ten legs \u2013 the front two are prominent pincers used for grasping. Their eyes protrude on short stalks, giving them a wide field of vision. The abdomen is small and typically tucked underneath the body, hidden by the broad carapace. Coloration varies greatly, ranging from sandy browns and greens to vibrant reds and blues, often with mottled patterns, but the overall shape is consistently broad and low to the ground.",
  "crocodile": "A crocodile is a large, low-slung reptile typically dark green or brown, with a long, tapered snout filled with visible teeth even when its mouth is closed. Its body is heavily armored with tough, bony plates forming scales. It has short legs with webbed feet, and a powerful, thick tail that makes up a significant portion of its overall length. They appear bulky and spend much of their time partially submerged in water, often with only eyes and nostrils visible above the surface.",
  "flatfish": "Flatfish are typically oval or diamond-shaped with both eyes located on the same side of their body \u2013 often the right side, though some species are left-eyed. Their bodies are remarkably thin and laterally compressed, appearing almost two-dimensional. Coloration varies greatly depending on species and environment, ranging from mottled browns and grays for camouflage on the seabed to brighter patterns, but they generally lack a strongly defined silvery sheen like many round fish. They blend into the seafloor, and their shape is distinctly wider than it is tall, resembling a flattened oval or rhombus.",
  "lamp": "A lamp is typically a stationary object featuring a base supporting a shade or exposed bulb designed to emit light. Bases can be made of various materials like metal, ceramic, or wood and come in many shapes \u2013 cylindrical, curved, or sculpted. Shades, when present, are often fabric, glass, or plastic and diffuse the light, appearing as conical, drum-shaped, or more decorative forms atop the light source. The visible portion generally ranges in size from small bedside lights to large floor-standing structures, and often includes a switch or other control mechanism. While styles vary greatly, a key visual element is a clearly defined area intended to *produce* visible light.",
  "maple_tree": "Maple trees exhibit a variety of sizes, from small shrubs to large trees, but are generally recognizable by their opposite leaf arrangement \u2013 meaning leaves grow in pairs directly across from each other on the branches. The leaves themselves are typically palmate, with 3-9 lobes having pointed tips, and often display vibrant fall colors ranging from yellow and orange to red. A key identifying feature, even without leaves, are the distinctive paired, winged seeds (samaras) often called \u201chelicopters\u201d or \u201cwhirlybirds\u201d that fall from the tree. Bark texture varies with age and species, but can be smooth when young, becoming furrowed or ridged with maturity.",
  "motorcycle": "A motorcycle is characterized by two in-line wheels, a long, exposed engine block typically positioned centrally within a visible frame, and a seat designed for one or two riders. It generally features handlebars for steering and foot pegs for foot placement. The overall shape is elongated and low to the ground, often with streamlined bodywork or exposed mechanical components. Key visual elements include tires with visible treads, a chain or belt drive connecting the engine to the rear wheel, and often a prominent exhaust pipe. Variations exist, but these core features are consistently present.",
  "otter": "Otters are streamlined, elongated mammals typically between 3-5 feet long, covered in dense, dark brown fur that appears almost black when wet. They have relatively small heads with rounded ears and whiskered snouts. A key feature is their long, muscular tail, making up about a third of their total length. Their feet are distinctly webbed and possess visible claws, appearing somewhat paddle-like. They have a generally sleek, playful appearance and a low-slung body posture, often seen moving fluidly in water or on land.",
  "sea": "The sea typically appears as a vast, predominantly blue expanse, though color can shift to green, grey, or even reddish hues depending on depth, sediment, and light conditions. It exhibits a dynamic, textured surface \u2013 often rippled with waves, sometimes smooth and glassy, and occasionally white-capped with foam. A clear horizon line usually separates the sea from the sky, though this can be obscured by mist or clouds. Landmasses, like coastlines, islands, or cliffs, frequently border the sea, and may be visible extending *into* it. The overall impression is one of immense scale and fluid movement.",
  "shark": "Sharks are typically long, streamlined fish, ranging in size from under a foot to over 40 feet. Their bodies are generally grey or brownish, though coloration varies widely by species. A key feature is their rigid, often asymmetrical tail fin\u2014the upper lobe noticeably larger than the lower.  They possess a noticeable lack of bright coloration or stripes, and their skin appears rough due to dermal denticles (tooth-like scales). They have visible gill slits on the sides of their head and a generally powerful, often pointed snout, frequently exhibiting rows of visible teeth when the mouth is open. While body shape varies (sleek, flattened, or stout), they lack the rounded bodies and visible scales of many other fish.",
  "television": "A television is typically a rectangular, flat, dark-colored (often black or grey) device with a large, smooth, flat screen dominating its front surface. It usually has a base or stand supporting it, or mounting points on the back for wall-hanging. Modern televisions are generally thin, while older models can be boxier and deeper. There's often a subtle bezel (frame) around the screen, and you may see small buttons or a recessed area at the bottom for controls, though many now rely on a remote. The overall impression is a broad, visually prominent display intended to be the focal point of a room.",
  "tractor": "A tractor is a large, robust vehicle typically dominated by massive, cleated rear wheels \u2013 often much larger than the front wheels, which are usually smaller and steerable. It has a prominent, boxy or cabbed body, frequently colored red, green, or yellow, with visible engine components and often attachments like a hitch for pulling implements. Expect to see a generally ground-hugging profile, built for power and stability, and a purposeful, utilitarian aesthetic lacking sleek curves; it\u2019s designed for work, not speed.",
  "baby": "A baby typically appears small and soft-bodied, with a proportionally large head compared to the rest of its body. Skin is generally smooth and delicate, often with a slightly reddish or pinkish hue. Features are rounded \u2013 cheeks, eyes, and limbs \u2013 and movement is largely limited to grasping, kicking, and rolling. They lack developed muscle tone and often have a pudgy appearance. Clothing is frequently soft and loose-fitting, and they may be swaddled or held closely by a caregiver. Hair may be sparse or fine, and overall size is significantly smaller than an adult or older child.",
  "bed": "A bed is typically a large, rectangular, horizontal structure found in bedrooms. It consists of a supportive frame, often made of wood or metal, topped with a mattress \u2013 a large, soft cushion for lying on. Beds frequently have a headboard at one end and may include side rails or a footboard. They are often covered with bedding like sheets, blankets, and pillows, creating a layered, cushioned appearance. Variations exist, including platform beds with low profiles, bunk beds stacked vertically, and beds with integrated storage drawers underneath, but the core element is a raised, cushioned surface designed for reclining.",
  "bicycle": "A bicycle is typically comprised of a large rear wheel and a smaller front wheel, connected by a triangular frame. A seat sits atop the frame, positioned above the pedals which are located near the bottom bracket where the frame connects to the crank arms. It features handlebars extending forward for steering, and often includes brakes accessible from the handlebars. Variations exist, but commonly displays two tires, a chain connecting the pedals to the rear wheel, and may include features like a basket, fenders, or multiple gears. The overall shape is long and relatively narrow, designed for a single rider.",
  "chimpanzee": "Chimpanzees are medium-sized apes with black or dark brown hair covering most of their body. They have a relatively flat face with a prominent brow ridge and large, expressive eyes surrounded by pink or bare skin. Their ears are medium-sized and rounded. They possess strong, muscular builds with long arms and shorter legs, adapted for both knuckle-walking and climbing. Hands and feet are similarly dexterous with opposable thumbs and toes. Skin color varies from pinkish to dark, depending on the individual, and is visible on the face, hands, and feet. They lack a prominent tail.",
  "fox": "A fox is a medium-sized mammal with a relatively slender build. It typically has reddish-brown fur, though color variations exist (silver, black, white). Key features include a long, pointed muzzle, erect and triangular ears, and a noticeably bushy tail, often as long as half its body length. Their eyes are typically bright and forward-facing, and they have relatively short legs. While size varies by species, they generally appear agile and lithe, not bulky or heavily muscled.",
  "leopard": "Drawing upon the defining characteristics, a leopard presents as a medium to large-sized cat with a typically tawny, yellowish-brown to golden coat. Its most distinctive feature is the pattern of black spots arranged in rosettes \u2013 irregular, flower-like markings\u2014covering its body, head, and limbs. While spot density varies, they are generally more densely packed on the flanks and smaller on the legs and head. They have a relatively long body, short powerful legs, and a long tail, often with spots transitioning to rings near the tip. Their eyes are typically a piercing yellow or amber color.",
  "man": "A man typically presents with a generally more angular facial structure and prominent brow ridge compared to a woman, often exhibiting facial hair like stubble, a beard, or mustache \u2013 though this is not always present. Body shape tends towards broader shoulders and a narrower waist, with generally larger hands and feet. Musculature is often more defined, though varies greatly with individual physique. Clothing is highly variable, but historically and statistically leans towards less traditionally ornate or revealing styles than those commonly associated with women. Skin texture can be coarser, and hair is often shorter, though again, these are not definitive indicators. Recognizing a man relies on a *combination* of these features, not any single one.",
  "pickup_truck": "A pickup truck is a vehicle typically with four wheels and a distinct two-part body. The front section resembles a standard car or SUV, containing an enclosed cabin for passengers. Directly behind the cabin is an open cargo bed, characterized by low sidewalls and a lowered rear gate (tailgate) used for loading and unloading. These trucks often have a robust, utilitarian appearance, and can range in size from compact to large with varying cabin configurations \u2013 regular, extended, or crew cab. They frequently feature a higher ground clearance and may have visible suspension components.",
  "plain": "A plain typically presents as a vast, flat or gently rolling landscape stretching to a distant horizon. Vegetation is generally low-growing \u2013 grasses, shrubs, or sparse trees \u2013 creating a largely unbroken visual field of a single color (often green, brown, or yellow depending on season/location). There are few prominent vertical features like mountains or steep hills; any changes in elevation are subtle. The sky dominates a large portion of the image, and the overall impression is one of openness and expansive distance, lacking significant texture or detail close to the viewer beyond the vegetation.",
  "poppy": "Poppies typically feature delicate, cup-shaped flowers with papery petals that come in vibrant colors like red, orange, pink, purple, and white. The flowers are often large relative to the plant's size, and frequently have a dark central blotch or eye surrounded by numerous stamens. Leaves are often grayish-green, deeply divided or lobed, and covered in fine hairs. Plants range in height depending on the species, but generally have slender, often branching stems. Seed pods are distinctive \u2013 rounded and capsule-like, containing many tiny seeds. While foliage varies, the overall impression is of a relatively airy, somewhat fragile plant with boldly colored, prominent blooms.",
  "rocket": "Rockets are typically tall, slender, and cylindrical in shape, often tapering to a point at one end. They are predominantly metallic or white/light-colored, frequently featuring prominent fins near the wider end for stabilization. Expect to see nozzles or exhaust ports at the base, often darkened from heat, and potentially multiple stages stacked upon each other. While size varies dramatically, they generally convey a sense of power and verticality, and may have external details like fuel tanks, antennae, or payload bays. They almost always lack traditional wheels or ground-contact features, suggesting a design intended for flight *from* the ground rather than travel *on* it.",
  "rose": "Roses are typically bushy, multi-stemmed shrubs ranging in size from under a meter to several meters tall. Their most recognizable feature is the presence of showy flowers, often with numerous overlapping petals arranged in a rounded or cup-like shape. Flower colors vary widely \u2013 red, pink, white, yellow, and blends thereof are common. Stems are often thorny or covered in prickles. Leaves are compound, typically with 5-9 leaflets that have serrated edges. Bud shape is initially pointed, gradually opening to reveal the flower, and mature rose hips (seed pods) can remain after flowering, appearing as rounded or oval shapes.",
  "snail": "Snails typically appear as small to medium-sized creatures with a prominent, often spirally coiled shell that encases their soft body. The shell comes in a huge variety of colors and patterns \u2013 ranging from brown and grey to brightly colored bands or spots \u2013 and can be smooth or textured. A fleshy foot extends from the shell opening, used for slow, gliding movement, and they usually have a pair of retractable tentacles on their head, often with eyespots at the tips. While shell shape varies, a visible spiral is a key characteristic, and they generally lack prominent legs or appendages beyond the foot. They can be found on various surfaces\u2014land, underwater, or in freshwater.",
  "sweet_pepper": "Sweet peppers are typically smooth-skinned and blocky, ranging in shape from bell-like with rounded lobes to more elongated and conical.

Sizes vary considerably, from small (a few centimeters) to quite large (over 10cm long), but they generally have a thick, fleshy wall and a relatively shiny surface. They lack the pointed or elongated shape of chili peppers, and are generally larger and more robust in appearance.",
  "table": "A table typically presents as a largely flat, horizontal surface \u2013 often rectangular or circular, but varying in shape \u2013 elevated off the ground by supports. These supports can be anywhere from one central pedestal to four or more individual legs, made of materials like wood, metal, or plastic. The surface itself can be made of similar materials, and may or may not have visible edges or a lip. Tables generally occupy a significant amount of visual space in a room and are designed to have objects placed *on* their flat top. They come in a wide range of sizes, from small side tables to large dining tables, but the core structure of a flat top and supporting legs remains consistent.",
  "telephone": "A telephone is typically a small, handheld device, though variations exist. Common features include a relatively flat body, often rectangular with rounded edges, featuring a prominent, flat display screen covering a significant portion of the front. Below the screen is usually a series of buttons or a touch-sensitive area for input. Many have a small earpiece at the top and a microphone near the bottom. Older models may lack a screen and instead feature a rotary dial or push buttons, and a separate handset connected by a coiled cord. Colors vary widely, but black, white, and silver are common. It's generally small enough to comfortably hold in one hand.",
  "wardrobe": "A wardrobe is a large, typically rectangular cabinet, often taller than a person. It features a flat top and base, and a prominent door or doors concealing internal space. Within, you\u2019ll usually see a horizontal rail running across for hanging clothes, and potentially shelves or drawers below. Wardrobes are commonly made of wood or wood-like materials and can range in style from simple, boxy shapes to ornate, decorated designs \u2013 but their defining feature is their size and function as dedicated clothing storage. They often have handles or knobs for opening the door(s).",
  "whale": "Whales are massive, elongated marine animals, typically dark gray or blue-gray in color, though some exhibit mottled patterns. They possess smooth, streamlined bodies lacking visible hind limbs, culminating in powerful horizontal tail flukes. A defining feature is the absence of a traditional nose; instead, they have one or two smooth blowholes on the top of their head.

Size varies dramatically, ranging from several meters to exceeding 30 meters in length \u2013 always significantly larger than most other marine life.",
  "woman": "A woman generally presents with softer facial features than a man, often including fuller lips, wider eyes, and higher cheekbones. Body shape typically exhibits wider hips and a narrower waist, potentially with visible breasts. Hairstyle is highly variable but frequently involves longer hair, though this isn\u2019t definitive. Clothing choices are also diverse, but often lean towards styles traditionally associated with femininity\u2014though this is a cultural construct and not a reliable indicator. Skin texture tends to be smoother, and body hair is generally less prominent than in men, although this varies greatly. It's important to note this is a generalization and significant overlap exists with other gender presentations.",
  "worm": "Here's a visual description for an AI model, based on the provided definition:\n\nWorms generally appear as long, slender, and flexible creatures, lacking distinct limbs or rigid structures like bones. Their bodies are typically cylindrical or flattened, and they exhibit a lack of obvious segmentation in some cases while others show repeating ring-like patterns. Coloration varies greatly, ranging from pale white or pink to brown, reddish, or even brightly colored, and their surfaces can be smooth, slightly textured, or covered in tiny bristles. Size varies enormously, from microscopic to several meters in length, but they consistently maintain an elongated, body plan without a defined head or tail in many instances. They often appear moist or glistening."
