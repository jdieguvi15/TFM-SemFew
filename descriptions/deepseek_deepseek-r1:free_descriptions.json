  "woman": "A woman can be visually recognized by typically softer facial features, such as a less pronounced brow ridge, rounder jawline, and higher cheekbones compared to adult males. Body proportions often include a narrower shoulder-to-hip ratio, with broader hips and a defined waist. Secondary sex characteristics like breast development are common, though size and shape vary widely. Hairstyles may range from short to long and culturally influenced, while clothing choices often reflect societal norms (e.g., dresses, skirts) but are not exclusive identifiers. Skin texture and muscle mass tend to be less rugged than in men, though this can differ based on age, genetics, or lifestyle. Note that these traits exist on a spectrum and may overlap with some male or nonbinary presentations.",
  "worm": "A worm typically appears as a slender, elongated, and cylindrical organism with a soft, unsegmented or minimally segmented body, often exhibiting smooth or slightly ridged textures. Its surface may range from translucent or pale hues (common in nematodes or larvae) to reddish-brown (as in earthworms), with a uniform width or subtle tapering at the extremities. Lacking limbs, eyes, or distinct appendages, its movement involves undulating contractions along its length when crawling or burrowing. The body is flexible, capable of stretching or coiling, and may show faint internal structures or subtle color gradients under light. In aquatic species, a translucent, ribbon-like form might be observed. Key identifiers include the absence of hardened shells, jointed segments, or complex body divisions, emphasizing simplicity in shape and texture."
