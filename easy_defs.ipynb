    " 'worm': \"A worm, visualized as a segmented, elongated, bilaterally symmetrical invertebrate, typically lacks appendages. Its body appears cylindrical and soft, with a visible hydrostatic skeleton allowing for flexible movement. Each segment, or metamere, may exhibit repeating structures like setae (bristle-like appendages, possibly visible under magnification), used for locomotion and anchoring. The worm's exterior is moist and slimy, possibly with a distinct color depending on species, like earthworms' pinkish-brown hue. Close-ups may reveal a simple mouth at the anterior end and an anus at the posterior, with a clitellum, a saddle-like band, visible on reproductive worms. No complex features like limbs, shells, or prominent eyes are present, and its environment is generally terrestrial or aquatic.\"}"
