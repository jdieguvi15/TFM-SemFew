      "The typical appearance of a wardrobe is a tall, rectangular piece of furniture with a flat top and a closed front, often with doors, drawers, or shelves. The images suggest a range of colors from light to dark brown, and some appear to have a smooth, glossy finish. While details are obscured, the wardrobes seem to have a traditional design with a focus on storage, and some may have handles or other hardware. Overall, they present as sturdy, functional pieces of furniture for storing clothing and personal items.\n",

      "🔹 WHALE:\n",
      "The class 'whale' appears to be characterized by a large, dark body, often with a white patch or belly, and a dorsal fin on its back; the body can be sleek and streamlined or robust, with a prominent tail that is sometimes visible above water, and the overall shape suggests a massive, aquatic mammal with a rounded head and a blowhole on top.\n",

      "The class 'woman' typically appears as a female with a variety of skin tones and hair colors and lengths, often with subtle makeup. They are usually smiling or looking slightly off-center, with visible eyes, noses, and mouths. The images suggest a range of ages and ethnicities, with varying hairstyles frequently pulled back; however, specific details are difficult to discern due to the blurriness of the images.\n",

      "🔹 WORM:\n",
      "The class 'worm' typically appears as a curved or wavy, elongated shape, often resembling a hook or a squiggly line. The color varies, with examples ranging from blue, purple, red, to brown, and light blue, against backgrounds of green, blue, or grey. The shapes are generally smooth and continuous, with no sharp edges or distinct features, giving a sense of fluidity and simplicity.\n",
